(last updated: Oct 18, 2015)

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game created in Swift, the iOS programming language. Swift was designed and launched by Apple Inc. in 2014. The language is based on Objective-C.

**Game Features:**
There is a single and multi-player state. The game is fully functional and stable at 60fps on an iPhone 5s/6. The game has simple animations using the “Spring” animation library.
In singleplayer the player goes up against the A.I. (a Tic Tac Toe algorithm).
