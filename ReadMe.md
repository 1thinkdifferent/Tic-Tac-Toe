Tic-Tac-Toe for iOS
================================
(last updated: June 8, 2015)

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game created in the swift programming language for iOS. The swift programming language was designed and launched by Apple Inc. in 2014. The language is based off Objective-C.

Game Features:
There is a singleplayer and multiplayer state. The game is fully functional and stable at 60fps on an iPhone 5s (phone model). The game has simple animations using the “Spring” animation library.
In singleplayer the player goes up against the A.I. (a Tic Tac Toe algorithm).
The following image describes the orientation of the projectors in the room:

There is also a follow developer button that redirects the player to @Ben_Emdon (www.twitter.com/Ben_Emdon) complete with animations.

All code files are inside /Tic Tac To.

	MultiplayerViewController.swift
	ViewController.swift
	FollowDevView.swift

Design
======

All the user interface elements were designed by Ben Emdon in Sketch for OSX. Rounded edges and minimalistic colour sets were used to keep the app as simple and intuitive as possible.

Implementation
==============

For the Tic Tac Toe game the following technologies were used:
- Xcode with storyBoard to visually design the app elements
- swift programming language with Apples UIKit framework for app development
- Meng To’s Spring animation library


Testing
=======

Testing the Tic Tac Toe Game application was made possible by the iOS simulator for OSX.


Conclusion
==========

Overall the project was a success. The given opportunity was seized. I will continue to learn app development with the swift programming language.
